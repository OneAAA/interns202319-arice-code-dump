This project relied on the efforts of me (Adam Rice), my colleague Liam Harcombe, my supervisors Timothy Duignan and Kasimir Gregory.
I used the software packages LAMMPS, MDAnalysis, SolvationAnalysis, and NequIP for my research.
I am unfamiliar with licensing, so everything is unlicensed.
Do not try to upkeep this repo, it is just a dump for a past project. You are welcome to fork it, just recognise my and my colleague and supervisors.
All information on the structure of this repo is in repo-structure.txt.
That's probably everything.
